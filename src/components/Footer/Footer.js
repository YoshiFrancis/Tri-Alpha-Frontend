            <p>Tri-Alpha is a group of 8 currently. Shall there be change, one does not know. We do not know the future.
                We are not gods. We are just Tri-Alpha. Who are the three leaders? I wonder. Maybe there are no three concrete leaders.
                Perhaps it is just the name. What does Tri-Alpha really mean...
